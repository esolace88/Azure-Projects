# Azure Projects

Welcome to my Azure Projects repository! This repository is a collection of practical projects showcasing the use of various Microsoft Azure services. The primary goal is to provide hands-on examples for deploying, managing, and working with applications in the Azure cloud environment.

## Repository Contents

At present, this repository focuses on two key areas of Azure:

1. **Azure SAS:** This section provides examples of working with Azure's SAS (Shared Access Signatures). SAS is a powerful feature in Azure for granting limited access to objects in your storage account to other clients, without exposing your account key. By using SAS, you can grant clients access to resources in your storage account, without sharing your account keys.

2. **Terraform:** This part is dedicated to projects utilizing Terraform with Azure. Terraform is a popular open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow for managing cloud service. It's used for creating, managing, and updating infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, network switches, containers, and more.

3. **Kubernetes CI/CD:** This project provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Kubernetes application on Azure. The actual application code for this project can be found in a separate repository: [AzureProjects-Kubernetes-CICD](https://github.com/esolace88/AzureProjects-Kubernetes-CICD.git).

Each project resides in its respective folder and includes a detailed README file explaining the specifics of the project, including the problem statement, approach, and results.

## Getting Started

To explore these projects, you need to clone this repository to your local machine. Here's how to do that:

```

After cloning, navigate to the individual project folder and follow the specific setup instructions detailed in each project's README file.

## Prerequisites

These projects require an active Azure account and a basic understanding of Azure services. Depending on the project, you may also need to install the Azure CLI, Terraform, and configure them with your Azure account details. Detailed prerequisites and setup instructions are provided within each project's folder.
